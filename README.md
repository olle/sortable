# Sortable

A jQuery plugin that enables sorting for UL and OL elements. It adds sorting
buttons to the list elements and integrates to a server backend by using Ajax
POST.

## Getting started

To try out the built in example, simply get the project source code and put it
in a PHP-enabled web root, or point to the project folder with your LAMP/MAMP
program, and you're ready to go.

Made with the hope of being of use to someone out there!
